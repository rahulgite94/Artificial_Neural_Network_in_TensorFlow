# Artificial_Neural_Network_in_TensorFlow
This repository consists of pdf file name Artificial Neural Network in A Nutshell and a python Notebook name Building an Artificial Neural Network in TensorFlow 2.0.ipynb.

A user can learn the theory of Artificial Neural Network from the pdf file and can practice the Python code from the Notebook. I tried to explain the concepts in the shortest and most efficient way possible. Notebook also contains the explanation of each and every code line. A user can use this repository as a sample when they are building an Artificial Neural Network model.

Hope this will help to understand the concepts and practice them at the same time.
