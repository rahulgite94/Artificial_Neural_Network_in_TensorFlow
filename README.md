# Artificial_Neural_Network_in_TensorFlow
This repository consist of pdf file name Artificial Neural Network in A Nutshell and a python Notebook name Building an Artificial Neural Network in TensorFlow 2.0.ipynb. 

A user can learn the theory of Artificial Neural Network from the pdf file and can practice the Python code from the Notebook. I tried to explain the concepts in the shortest and most efficient way possible. Notebook also contains the explaination of each and every code line. A user can use this repository as sample when they are building a Artificial Nerural Network model.

Hope this will help to understand the concepts and practice them at the same time.
